# My website is designed to showcase my images and provide contact information to enquire about imaging

# I made 3 pages, index.html, gallery.html, contact.html in a clean simple layout to look like an imaging website

# On the home page, I have some welcoming text with images to bring user attention

# I also made a gallery page, to show the images in a clean grid layout

# And lastly, I made a contact page with a form to submit your information and get into contact with me

# Written with HTML5, CSS, Python

# Adobe Illustrator used for Logo design

# Photoshop used to retouch site images

# Includes folder missing but can be found here:
